### Added
- Example recipes for generic compounding (metal alloyer, recrystallizer) to JEI [#346]

  - Trades are incomplete
  - Does not spawn naturally
### Fixed
- "Useful Flora" advancement not having fluffy puff/seeds criteria

## [2.6.7] - 2021-03-07
### Added
- Sheet metal materials. Metals can be pressed into sheets. Not suitable for tools and makes weaker armor than the base materials, but can also be used to craft elytra.
- Metal press, used to craft sheet metal
- Missing translation keys for fluffy plants
### Changed
- Tyrian steel recipe now requires crushed shulker shell and ancient debris instead of nether stars
- Elytra now have a 25x durability modifier (up from 12x)
  - Elytra armor durability stat of phantom membrane and fine silk reduced to roughly match previous values

## [2.6.5] - 2021-02-24
### Added
- Self repair traits, which can repair (or damage) gear gradually over time.

- Bounce trait. On boots, it nullifies fall damage, consuming durability based on the fall distance. On armor, it knocks back attackers.
  - Found on slime lining (existing items in your inventory will gain the trait)
  - Note: This is also intended to cause the wearer to bounce, as if they landed on slime blocks. This does not work well, so that code is currently disabled.
- Traits can now specify conditions. Trait instances on materials and parts can still have conditions as well, but most of the `gear_type` conditions have moved to the trait files.
### Changed
- Manually split the armor stats of extra mod metals and made some slight tweaks on some

### Added
- Horse armor salvaging recipes (Gmoney2123) [#331]
- Some work on new materials (items added in 2.6.2), incomplete
### Fixed

## [2.6.2] - 2021-02-19
### Added
- JEI support for compounders (metal alloyer and recrystallizer)
- All fluffy puff-related stuff moved to Silent Gear from Silent's Gems (old Gems version will remain until 1.17)
  - Seeds are obtained from wild fluffy plants. Search in less-dry biomes, like forests.
  - Fluffy blocks now bounce the player, similar to beds (they still reduce damage based on stack depth as well)
  - Added fluffy feathers and fluffy string, which can be crafted into vanilla items if necessary
  - New textures for some blocks and items
  - Materials coming soon
- Fine Silk (rare drop from spiders, double rate for cave spiders) and Fine Silk Sloth. Both will be materials.

## [2.6.1] - 2021-02-18
### Added

  - Recipe (may change, JEI support coming soon): 1 each of crimson steel ingot, azure electrum ingots, and nether star in the metal alloyer
- Sturdy trait: has a high chance of reducing damage taken by gear
- Void Ward trait: attempts to save the player from falling out of the world (only works on armor). Knocks the player upward and gives levitation and slow falling when taking void damage. 
- Materials can now be searched for traits, categories, and part types in JEI, but JEI's `SearchAdvancedTooltips` config must be enabled
  - This works by dumping a list of terms on the last line of the tooltip when building "advanced" tooltips (F3+H mode)

- Stats for vine binding
- Blaze rod and end rod materials (rod only part subs)

## [2.6.0] - 2021-02-10
### Added
- Compound materials. These are still being fine-tuned, so expect changes. They are completely optional and nothing else has changed yet. [#326]
  - The plan for 1.17 is to disallow material mixing in the crafting grid by default, requiring compound materials to get mixing bonuses
  - Currently there are two compound crafters, the Metal Alloyer and Recrystallizer
  - Recipes can also be added to either block for crafting custom materials or other items
### Changed
- Tooltip keybindings will now be ignored and default to old behavior if unbound or bound to either left/right modifier keys [#319]
- New shield model and texture (UnmovingJaveline)
- Fix spear model offsets (UnmovingJaveline)

## [2.5.5] - 2021-01-31
### Added
- Config option to allow repairs without repair kits (item.repairKits.efficiency.missing). Default value is zero, which requires repair kits. If enabled, repair kits may still be used. [#316]

### Fixed
- Some armor items having incorrect armor values [#304]
- Crash when creating gear models in some cases

## [2.0.8] - 2020-08-09
### Fixed
- Prospector hammer crashing servers

## [2.0.7] - 2020-08-09
### Added
- Fragments. These are partial material items which may be returned by the salvager [#191]
- Prospector hammer. Works like a pickaxe, works in any recipe requiring a hammer. Using on the side of a block (not the top or bottom) will search a small area in that direction for ores. The blocks the prospector hammer searches for can be set in the `silentgear:prospector_hammer_targets` block tag (not an item tag). The tag contains just the `forge:ores` tag by default.
- Some nether chests can now contain netherwood saplings and Nether metal ingots/nuggets
### Fixed
- Quick gear recipes creating the wrong tool head for some tools

## [2.0.6] - 2020-08-07
### Added
- Highlight selected slot of blueprint book
### Changed
- Crimson steel is now tier 4
- Armor textures updated
- Tweaked binding and grip textures to fit the model more tightly

## [2.0.5] - 2020-08-04
### Added

- Moonwalker trait. Reduces gravity, but only works on boots
- Azure repair kit
- Magic armor stat now actually works
### Changed
- Trait calculations for gear items. They now take the highest level of any trait from any part. Compound parts still follow the old logic. [#93]
- Gear type stat modifiers have been moved to the tool head part JSON files. This allows them to be customized with data packs.
- Default capacity of repair kits to 16, 32, 48, and 64
### Fixed
- Stacked blueprint dupe [#199]
- Harvest levels incorrect on tool heads with mixed materials
- Armor not giving a "has broken" message

## [2.0.4] - 2020-08-03
### Added
- Brilliant trait, makes piglins non-aggressive on armor. Requires the primary material to have the trait.
- New trait condition `silentgear:primary_material`, requires the trait to be on the primary (first) material
- Conflicting material crafting item detection, displays potential conflicts in chat on login
### Fixed

- (Maybe) Occasional crash in ColorUtils, exact cause unknown

## [2.0.2] - 2020-07-29
1.16.1-only bug fix
### Added
- Part substitute items for materials. This allows items to be specified as parts made of their respective material. [#194]
- Rod substitutes for iron, stone, wood, netherwood, and rough wood [#194]
### Fixed
- Rough tool recipes not working [#194]

## [2.0.1] - 2020-07-28
### Added
- Granite, diorite, and andesite materials (same stats as stone by default) [#193]
### Changed
- Repair kit will now discard materials if less than 0.01 units remain (no longer shows 0.0 units)
### Fixed
- Temp fix for salvager dupe bug. Compound parts other than tool heads can no longer be broken down into materials for now. [#191]
- Armor and shield blueprints not working from the blueprint book
- Repair kits repairing items with lower tier materials

- Pressing "Cycle Back" when viewing material info causing a crash in some cases

## [2.0.0] - 2020-07-26
Major overhaul of model system (again)
(hotfix) Fixed blueprint book being consumed when crafting
### Added
- Blueprint book. Yeah, I finally figured it out. Stores blueprints, but not templates. Use Z or C to cycle stored blueprints, or open the book and Ctrl+click the blueprint you want. The cycle keys will work whenever your mouse cursor is over the book. It will even update the crafting result when cycling.
- Repair kits now store materials instead of "repair value". Any repair value in existing kits will be lost. The number of materials that can be stored is configurable. Repairs can use partial materials, so there is still no waste.
- Repair kits now have different "efficiency" levels, giving more incentive to upgrade. Values are configurable.
### Changed
- Gear and part models now support custom textures added with resource packs.
- Material rendering info is now loaded from `assets/silentgear/silentgear_materials` (that's "assets", not "data")
- 'server' config is now 'common' and will appear in the config folder, like most configs do
- Cycle material info key binding changed to "Cycle Next". The "Cycle Back" key will also work with material tooltips. These are the same keys that blueprint books use.
### Fixed
- Shears not losing durability on leaves [#188]
- Parts not showing some conditional traits [#186]
- Some missing lang keys
